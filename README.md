# Citi Bike Trip History Logs Data Dashboard

This project aims to create a data dashboard, story, or report by aggregating the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs. The project will involve acquiring the data, dumping it into a tableau, connecting with business users to understand the data attributes and KPIs, building a production-based dashboard, and performing user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the dashboard meets the stakeholders' expectations. 

## Data Acquisition and Storage

The first step of the project involves acquiring the Citi Bike Trip History Logs data and storing it in an Excel File. 

## Understanding the Data Attributes and KPIs

To create a meaningful data dashboard, we need to understand the data attributes and key performance indicators (KPIs) that the stakeholders are interested in. We will connect with business users to understand their requirements and tailor the dashboard to meet their needs.

## Building the Data Dashboard

We will start building the data dashboard based on the KPIs and user requirements. The dashboard will be designed for different user hierarchies and organizations.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs will be captured in the data dashboard:

- Total number of trips recorded during the chosen period.
- Percentage increase in total ridership.
- Proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers.
- Peak hours in which bikes are used during summer and winter months.
- Top 10 stations in the city for starting and ending a journey.
- Bottom 10 stations in the city for starting and ending a journey.
- Gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female).
- Effectiveness of gender outreach in increasing female ridership.
- Average trip duration change by age.
- Average distance in miles that a bike is ridden.


## Additional Visualizations

City officials would like to see the following visualizations:

- A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
- A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.
- The final dashboard will be presented in a focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling format. The analysis will be thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes.

## Requirements

To open and use the project, you will need:

- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader version 2020.4 or later.
- An internet connection to access the data sources.
