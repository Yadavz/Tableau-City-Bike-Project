The Citi Bike Trip History Logs Data Dashboard project aims to create a data dashboard by aggregating data from Citi Bike Trip History Logs. The project involves acquiring and storing data, understanding data attributes and KPIs, and building a production-based dashboard. The dashboard will be tailored to meet the requirements of different user hierarchies and organizations. The key performance indicators (KPIs) to be captured in the dashboard include total trips recorded, percentage increase in ridership, customer and subscriber proportion, peak hours, top and bottom stations for starting and ending a journey, gender breakdown of active participants, effectiveness of gender outreach, average trip duration by age, and average distance ridden. The project will also include additional visualizations such as static and dynamic maps. The requirements to use the project are Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader version 2020.4 or later and an internet connection to access the data sources.
